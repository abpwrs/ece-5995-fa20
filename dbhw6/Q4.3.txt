Update the graph to add a relation labeled genre_pref between users and genres nodes with
a preference property computed to be the average rating for the movies in that genre the user has
rated (do not add a relationship if the user has not rated any movies in the genre).

MATCH (u:User)-[r:RATED]->(:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
WITH u, g, AVG(r.rating) AS avgRating
MERGE (u)-[p:GENRE_PREF]->(g)
SET p.preference = avgRating
